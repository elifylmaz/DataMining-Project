60,"Capitalism is more insidious now than it ever was. There used to be a simple dynamic: merchants, manufacturers, and landowners exploited labourers to create profit. Inequality was obvious. But now, in an era of service sector dominance, liberalism as elitism, and class prefaced as theoretical, lines are blurred. Who are the exploited? *silence* Obviously, still the workers. But capitalism has convinced half the world that the rich suffer. Parasite is a Rorschach test. Some see only the base analogy and go ""who is the real parasite?"". Please don't be that person. Capitalism is inherently parasitic, not because rich and poor equally exploit each other, but because the rich exploit the poor and the poor also exploit the poor. This is the central thesis of Parasite, which is why it comes down to two working class families fighting each other, and the rich just allowing it through indifference. No longer are the rich just evil mill owners watching as poor people die in the street, they are now nice people like me and you, who just don't like to hear about bad things so do nothing as millions suffer in poverty. Same end result, just marketed better. If you can't understand why Ki-taek stabs Mr Park, you're proof that a century of capitalism has convinced us not to fight for change. Parasite is the perfect analogy for the friendly face of exploitation we now accept as reasonable. Please leave us to die, all we want is to dream of having a house as nice as yours. We won't fight Mr Park, in fact, we respect you for everything.

93,"Just rewatched this timeless, best decade-ender film of the 2010s along with a friend of mine, who began venturing into Asian cinema for the first time today. Parasite is a Korean dramedy thriller film tackling class division by juxtaposing the lives of the affluent Park family and the penurious Kim family. Director Bong Joon-ho has been criticizing the growing social class divide in South Korea with his previous films and, despite being his recently released film, Parasite is probably the most critical, cut-throat film of his that perfectly captures the attention of his audience by combining comedy and thriller, while simultaneously showing the harsh realities of being in the South Korean working class. The storytelling, directorship, pacing, and cinematography blended in such a way that every scene becomes either emotionally appalling or stirring in its finest. Its message and symbolism has never been as relevant as today, considering that the rich can afford to rent private islands to escape the pandemic while the poor are getting eviction and unemployment notices.

136,"Pretty toothless imo, the kind of satire intended to feel incisive without actually offending those at the centre of its ostensible target. Content to gently mock the obliviousness of the rich without actually digging into the systemic abuses their existence allows beyond obvious acts of little dehumanisation. Or, at least, I don't think Bong really pulls off what's maybe supposed to be here, so lightly does he connect the cannibalisation of the working class to the rich family above them that it feels like he's letting that family off the hook. There are no real characters here, just sketches that Bong and co allow to battle with such precise direction and strong humour that the film around them appears to actually slice open the facade it mocks without ever really doing so. When every character is equally thin, letting the ones up top remain simply foolish instead of malicious on any level feels both cowardly and lazy. Maybe that's the kind of satire that allows a class comedy to win top prize at the most prestigious film festival in the world, and maybe I wouldn't be so harsh on this if it wasn't presented in a semi-arthouse context (with a BS, audience-implicating look to the camera). If this was made as a clear lark by some random genre-head and it premiered at Fantastic Fest or whatever, I'd probably give it more slack. But it's not, it's made by one of the most respected international filmmakers currently working, one who has enough recognition to actually get real play in English-language countries. So it feels like a cop-out, which made it feel tiresome and a bit boring.",pretty toothless imo kind satire intended feel incisive without actually offending centre ostensible target content gently mock obliviousness rich without actually digging systemic abuses existence allows beyond obvious acts little dehumanisation least dont think bong really pulls whats maybe supposed lightly connect cannibalisation working class rich family feels like hes letting family hook real characters sketches bong co allow battle precise direction strong humour film around appears actually slice open facade mocks without ever really every character equally thin letting ones top remain simply foolish instead malicious level feels cowardly lazy maybe thats kind satire allows class comedy win top prize prestigious film festival world maybe wouldnt harsh wasnt presented semiarthouse context bs audienceimplicating look camera made clear lark random genrehead premiered fantastic fest whatever id probably give slack made one respected international filmmakers currently working one enough recognition actually get real play englishlanguage countries feels like copout made feel tiresome bit boring,pretty toothless imo kind satire intended feel incisive without actually offending centre ostensible target content gently mock obliviousness rich without actually digging systemic abuse existence allows beyond obvious act little dehumanisation least dont think bong really pull whats maybe supposed lightly connect cannibalisation working class rich family feel like he letting family hook real character sketch bong co allow battle precise direction strong humour film around appears actually slice open facade mock without ever really every character equally thin letting one top remain simply foolish instead malicious level feel cowardly lazy maybe thats kind satire allows class comedy win top prize prestigious film festival world maybe wouldnt harsh wasnt presented semiarthouse context b audienceimplicating look camera made clear lark random genrehead premiered fantastic fest whatever id probably give slack made one respected international filmmaker currently working one enough recognition actually get real play englishlanguage country feel like copout made feel tiresome bit boring,positive
137,"In Parasite, many scenes are characterized by the presence of stairs going up and down: from those of the splendid villa of the rich Park family, to the incredibly long stairways that surround the city of Seoul, and which lead up to the squalid and smelly neighborhood where the proletarian Kims live. Bong Joon-ho's film is the story of a social opposition and the difficulties that people belonging to the lower classes have to face in trying to improve their condition. Often, in fact, those who find themselves at the bottom of the ""ladder"" desperately try to move up the the steps of society, so as to redeem the misery of their original situation. Nevertheless, those with great wealth and a high social position tend to neglect the reality of the weaker sections of the population and such disregard comes at a cost. The South Korean director weaves these themes together in an ironic and grotesque introduction, which however later gives way to more dramatic and disturbing tones. The shift in register is unsettling, but inserted in a very natural way into the narrative, thanks to a masterful writing and direction, and to the perfect performances by an ensemble cast.",parasite many scenes characterized presence stairs going splendid villa rich park family incredibly long stairways surround city seoul lead squalid smelly neighborhood proletarian kims live bong joonhos film story social opposition difficulties people belonging lower classes face trying improve condition often fact find bottom ladder desperately try move steps society redeem misery original situation nevertheless great wealth high social position tend neglect reality weaker sections population disregard comes cost south korean director weaves themes together ironic grotesque introduction however later gives way dramatic disturbing tones shift register unsettling inserted natural way narrative thanks masterful writing direction perfect performances ensemble cast,parasite many scene characterized presence stair going splendid villa rich park family incredibly long stairway surround city seoul lead squalid smelly neighborhood proletarian kims live bong joonhos film story social opposition difficulty people belonging lower class face trying improve condition often fact find bottom ladder desperately try move step society redeem misery original situation nevertheless great wealth high social position tend neglect reality weaker section population disregard come cost south korean director weave theme together ironic grotesque introduction however later give way dramatic disturbing tone shift register unsettling inserted natural way narrative thanks masterful writing direction perfect performance ensemble cast,positive

260,"Words fail to measure accurately and deeply enough the full mastery of narrative structured storytelling to film that is the seminal, genre defying, soulful and universal, best film of the last decade, best film of the 2010s period, one of the films ever made, magnum opus of the tallest order, Parasite. It doesn‚Äôt get better than this movie. I saw this film four times in theaters at the time of its release in 2019 and immediately was besotted by it and still am to this day. I‚Äôve seen it countless other times including twice before writing this now. Parasite exists as a rare bird, flawless in execution and completely immaculate and spellbinding in structure and rendering. Not a moment isn‚Äôt perfection. Every single performance transcends language barriers, the full measure of each individual captured in their essence and physicality, cadence and inner demeanor revealed and or hidden based on any given circumstance, the dialogue read through subtitles is a delicious treat to analyze the specificity of the words used in this already full cooked and wonderful five course meal of a movie. This is easily the best foreign language film ever made. I would recommend this movie to anyone, including people who only casually watch movies. This is the cream of the crop in every regard. Bong Joon Ho take a bow. You are a titan of cinema. You are one of the greatest to ever craft film. What a time to be alive and to be present as your works are released. This is a monumental achievement in every capacity from directing to writing, production design to editing, a marvelous movie. The film was nominated for 6 Academy Awards including: Best Editing and Best Production Design and it won 4 Oscars for Best International Feature, Best Screenplay, Best Directing and Best Picture. That alone is a testimony to everything I am already emphasizing. This movie just that incredible that it would win the Oscar for Best Picture on top of winning Best International Feature. Let alone also wining Best Director and Best Screenplay. The movie is so incredible it transcends language barriers. This movie better never be remade, it already is a perfect movie for audiences across the world, no need to reimagine what already was rendered flawlessly. The picture is always engaging, it‚Äôs also flat out hilarious consistently, it‚Äôs truly riveting, astoundingly shocking, surprising, taut, suspenseful, gut wrenching, poetic and deeply prophetic analyzing the wealth inequalities and social disparities in society in ways that are unmistakably brilliant and inspiringly indelible visually and narratively. This movie takes my breath away, it engulfs me in a time and space beyond my own, yet completely taking me there and paints fully realized complex, surprisingly likable regardless of immoral acts and riveting characters to discover and dissect. The themes of the piece staggeringly layered and resonating on every level as supreme truth. They can and should and probably will teach film study classes highlighting this movie specifically. To even begin to feel like I address with specificity the brilliance entailed in this picture for me would be analyzing the characters and what they mean to the overall narrative and what numerous things the picture is reflecting on directly and confidently through them as the plot unfolds. Cho Yeo-jeong as Yeon Kyo portrays an ignorant vapid pompous one percent housewife in such a riveting way, met with a dense and deeply rich screenplay, the character an avatar for all that is wrong in societies where individuals learn the rules of the look and the presentation of laudable living but never got the memo about the inner substance that should be on display and at the root of everything the bloomed externally into fruition around it. The way she enters the movie by needing to be alerted back into conciseness is such a brilliant choice, as this character internally is a mess of a person who is always gullibly available to placate this idea that she isn‚Äôt good enough to begin with. A seminal statement of the human condition and it‚Äôs need to showcase perfection where it doesn‚Äôt actually exist. A scream in the dark from the collective when for far too long and with no resolution in sight, misaligned individuals have dominated in the game of haves and the have nots, disdainfully ignorant to the greater good or the plight existing for so many right outside their carefully crafted exuberance. The inner life of her and her husband revealing a lack of morality and substance, ignorance and feigned moral superiority just illusions that the lucky can bask in falsely signifying significance in a decaying culture where nothing actually matters. The husband and man of the house, Dong Ik played wonderfully by the late Lee Sun-kyun brilliantly showcases the lack of a man with everything, the juxtaposition startling; he doesn‚Äôt truly love his wife and he demands his workers do belittling jobs because they are being paid handsomely for it. The beginning and end of it all is just money to him. The stank of poverty, a real permeating stench, also unabiding to his very core being, his disdain and superiority complex in every measure found in his externalized riches, ignorant to the fact of his wife‚Äôs lack of substance or his own as he meanders around the narrative judging and shaming everything that he deems appropriately placed there but in private sometimes being turned on and gratified by those very same things. A human action and way of being that is universal and masked, he and his wife overly emphasis casual sex or drug use as deplorable in public and to themselves but actually deeply long for both things internally. The facade and illusion of grand exuberance and the behavior that the world finds to be simpatico to that lifestyle known to all that desire it, cutting themselves off from their primal urges to facilitate a facade of specificity and specialness that in and of itself is also an illusion. Their son is clearly just a simple child and every emphasis placed on him comes from a deeper place and need from both characters to project greatness onto their experience in order to thrive, including misplaced greatness on their son. The fact on an energetic level that these souls demand these constructs of being is why they are placed in these circumstances in their walking life to begin with. For most people the world can when it feels like it emphasis one‚Äôs failings, be a very negative place. The way that life has unfolded for Chung Sook, brilliantly played by Jang Hye-jin, subtly showcased in photos and medals and her behavior when she‚Äôs allowed to relax and showcase her gifts, an athlete of merit who couldn‚Äôt find a place in the world passed a certain age, a harsh reality that makes her feel bad all the time. Bitterness and stagnation becoming the default mood for her and her husband, the magnetic and prolific Song Kang-ho as Ki Taek. Through expository dialogue in passing we learn he is a man of jovial spirits who ventured into so many odd jobs in life fueled by his childlike spirit, and none of them worked out. He has now ultimately succumb to the notion that corruption is what leads to profit and that everything is pointless and irrelevant ultimately. Another way of being that hinders this entire family at its core. His brilliant speech to his son about why one should never have a plan in life is chilling to the bone as he is analyzing that no deed good or bad even matters in the world. He is a testimony to the grave unprocessed trauma and negativity inside millions if not billions of individuals, unknowingly blocking blessings and living in deep resentment for the other who lives in contentment and disdain and literal disgust for him and anyone else in misfortune for the majority of their life. The smell just sticks to them, an essence showcasing someone‚Äôs lack fundamentally, an internal miswiring exposed and evident in their life and lack of abundance externally. This indignity, a persons failure unknowingly caused by their own inner perspectives and motivations, exposed redundantly in exposition emphasized in the narrative and cause for murder at the end of the picture. Very earned and very iconically designed and executed. Anyone who misses the point as to why he kills his boss is also subtly ignoring the brimming tension and exposure to the fundamental disdain the one percent has for everyone else, a cathartic act in the third act that summates the consequence of these inevitable collisions internally that all humans go through when dealing with this topic of success or failure in life experiences. It‚Äôs almost as if to say metaphorically speaking life‚Äôs report card comes due for all individuals and the awareness that one has over their own life and the perspective other people place on them is enough to drive extreme emotions and pathos to the forefront in any individual. In the midst of these two characters lives and the fostering of this defeatist environment are my two favorite characters in the entire narrative, the ruthless and seemingly maniacal brother and sister duo of Ki Woo and Ki Jung played brilliantly and unforgettably by Choi-Woo sik and Park So-dam. These two have been born into this circumstance and are at the start of the film already living in the ramifications of coming from these beginnings, trying to get the pizza box guy fired to take over his job even before the main scheme of the narrative is presented to them. These performers both effortlessly and indelibly capture the essence of a youth lost to itself and struggling to find a place at the table, the singularity of each individuals wants trumping any code of ethics or relationship connection, their wants and needs never met and always in flux. Even as these characters perform illicit acts on unassuming individuals, their complexly woven essences and enduring like-ability never eludes them at any juncture. So many scenes showcase their inner truths and plights and their explorations always feel honest. My favorite moment in a movie with endless amazing ones being a cigarette break in a bathroom with rising sewage water almost overtaking the entire frame. These are people in the midst of a world that gave up on them still good hearted. The son especially desires to make his accomplishments externally validated even if it will take him many years to attain. The brother and sister are both growing and trying to find themselves, there isn‚Äôt any malice in the intention of their behavior, by design they have to claw their way to the metaphorical top by any means necessary. The cards have already been stacked against them. In an odd way they are the two most relatable characters in the picture, victims of the inequality and disparages depicted in societies everywhere and again the two characters are not consciously even bad people. I love the moment in the film where the daughter drunkenly yells out that they need to be focusing on themselves only, this inner modality key to understanding the perspective of all the characters in the scheming family as they seek to better their lives and see almost no way forward otherwise. Everyone in the picture is wonderful. There are other subplots and main characters in the movie but they all end up being incidentals to the point in a greater sense about the irrelevancy and decaying circumstance of the situations at hand, altruism and altruistic desire the thrust of everyone‚Äôs life in culture today and the spill over of it explored in many different individuals who all struggle to attain what they want and some struggling to simply survive. The twists and turns and additional characters in the narrative not mentioned specifically by me also enhance a theme of reflection as to who is a parasite and what constitutes the need for that facility in society and life to begin with, leaving ponderous moments in hindsight that also cement this picture as iconic god tier level cinema. Honestly every single thing about this picture is incredible from its thrilling third act blood bath to its taut and hilarious scathing indictment on the upper echelon scheme externalized in fruition first third to its startling and horrific tonal shift and dramatic explorations mid point through when a previously fired housekeeper shows up mysteriously late at night. Not to mention the tense and immaculately designed sequence where the scheming family tries to elude being seen and caught by the returning wealthy family, back from a vacation much sooner than expected. The layout of the house and how it‚Äôs design is immaculately woven into the narrative as it unfolds especially at this juncture is stupendous. The camera work and the framing of this movie is spellbinding. Every single shot feels perfect. This is a staggeringly brilliant and fully realized masterpiece. This is such a competently designed and executed vision. This is something to behold, one of the very greatest in all of art and cinema, forevermore.                                                                                             2019 Films

315,"I could imagine the reaction an audience member would have to seeing The Godfather or The Shawshank Redemption for the first time at its release is similar to how we treat this movie. Already it‚Äôs claimed best of all time status as Bong Joon Ho‚Äôs perfect genre blend of dark comedy, thriller and social satire makes for one of the greatest films I‚Äôve ever had the pleasure of seeing. Stunning visual storytelling that differentiates the two classes of these families without feeling on the nose or protentious. For instance a rain storm to the Parks might seem like a beautiful thing but to people like the Kims it‚Äôs a detriment and a destructive force that will inflict massive damage on their home. He demonstrates two different meanings of an event for two different classes all done with stunning symbolism and breathtaking cinematography. While being a technical mastery it‚Äôs also extremely funny and the type of humour implemented is so smart and clever and it stays true to the kind of characters these people are. Unlike a lot of other ‚Äúhollywoodised‚Äù films the lower class characters are portrayed as extremely intelligent people because they have to be to survive. The way that they widdle themselves into exclusive positions with this high class family is extremely clever and well done. As well as that the wealthy family isn‚Äôt portrayed as complete villains or idiots. The film doesn‚Äôt give you a reason to hate them, but you can also see where the lower class family is coming from as their hatred and anger towards these people begins to  grow. But there‚Äôs a certain point in the story where the film shifts and no longer remains funny and turns into an extremely serious film. I‚Äôm almost tempted to use the word scary when describing the events that occur, and I say that because everything that happens feels plausible and real. There‚Äôs no glitz or glamour sugar coated over the top of this dark and twisted story. The subtle imagery shown throughout the film creates its own narrative and makes you understand where each of these characters are coming from. Where a lot of films fall short is not knowing when they‚Äôre showing too much and this film understands that brilliantly and leaves a lot to be ambiguous and it works perfectly. It makes you create scenarios in your head as to what will happen to these characters, what will they do tomorrow? When a film has you thinking about it long after you watch it, you know you have a classic on your hands and that‚Äôs exactly what Parasite is.",could imagine reaction audience member would seeing godfather shawshank redemption first time release similar treat movie already claimed best time status bong joon hos perfect genre blend dark comedy thriller social satire makes one greatest films ive ever pleasure seeing stunning visual storytelling differentiates two classes families without feeling nose protentious instance rain storm parks might seem like beautiful thing people like kims detriment destructive force inflict massive damage home demonstrates two different meanings event two different classes done stunning symbolism breathtaking cinematography technical mastery also extremely funny type humour implemented smart clever stays true kind characters people unlike lot hollywoodised films lower class characters portrayed extremely intelligent people survive way widdle exclusive positions high class family extremely clever well done well wealthy family isnt portrayed complete villains idiots film doesnt give reason hate also see lower class family coming hatred anger towards people begins grow theres certain point story film shifts longer remains funny turns extremely serious film im almost tempted use word scary describing events occur say everything happens feels plausible real theres glitz glamour sugar coated top dark twisted story subtle imagery shown throughout film creates narrative makes understand characters coming lot films fall short knowing theyre showing much film understands brilliantly leaves lot ambiguous works perfectly makes create scenarios head happen characters tomorrow film thinking long watch know classic hands thats exactly parasite,could imagine reaction audience member would seeing godfather shawshank redemption first time release similar treat movie already claimed best time status bong joon ho perfect genre blend dark comedy thriller social satire make one greatest film ive ever pleasure seeing stunning visual storytelling differentiates two class family without feeling nose protentious instance rain storm park might seem like beautiful thing people like kims detriment destructive force inflict massive damage home demonstrates two different meaning event two different class done stunning symbolism breathtaking cinematography technical mastery also extremely funny type humour implemented smart clever stay true kind character people unlike lot hollywoodised film lower class character portrayed extremely intelligent people survive way widdle exclusive position high class family extremely clever well done well wealthy family isnt portrayed complete villain idiot film doesnt give reason hate also see lower class family coming hatred anger towards people begin grow there certain point story film shift longer remains funny turn extremely serious film im almost tempted use word scary describing event occur say everything happens feel plausible real there glitz glamour sugar coated top dark twisted story subtle imagery shown throughout film creates narrative make understand character coming lot film fall short knowing theyre showing much film understands brilliantly leaf lot ambiguous work perfectly make create scenario head happen character tomorrow film thinking long watch know classic hand thats exactly parasite,positive

394,"Bong Joon-ho's least imaginative film to date, and (perhaps because of that fact) the least ""Bong"" film he's made. One of the things that make Bong's two international co-productions, Snowpiercer and Okja, so disappointing for me is the absence of geographical and political specificity in their critique of capitalism (and by extension, Bong‚Äôs own aesthetic specificities). In the case of Snowpiercer, Bong's commentary on class struggle is especially feeble precisely because his attack on the global capitalist order remains abstract. Okja arguably does a better job in this regard, but not by much. It seems to me that Bong has yet to recover from his international co-production malady in spite of the return to his home ground. I am baffled by David Ehrlich's vapid assertion that with Parasite, ""Bong Joon-ho has become a genre unto himself."" He might want to revisit Memories of Murder, The Host and Mother, and rethink what he wrote.

546,"Without a doubt, the easiest 5 star rating I‚Äôve ever given. This film exceeds expectations on every possible level, even on a second watch. It is the most popular, and the highest rated film on Letterboxd for good reason. It appeals to the cinephile crowd by being filled with allegory and metaphor while exploring and questioning the underlining fundamentals of the systems that have always been in place, and it also appeals to general audiences by being one of the most wildly entertaining movies ever, excellent usage of editing, and an original premise which is fascinating enough to keep your interest for the entire film. I find the juxtaposition of the opposite social classes to be pretty spot on at times, but it‚Äôs effective nonetheless. If I had to say one negative thing about this film, it would be about how Bong portrays the lower class Kim family as people who are only capable of getting by through living a con life. But I also don‚Äôt fully disagree with this portrayal because in a way, the lower class is powerless to the hierarchies of a capitalist society. But really, Bong portrays this family as lazy over anything, unmotivated to even complete the simple task of folding pizza boxes. But this misportrayal of an entire social class is quickly lost in the insanity of the turn that the film takes in the second half.",without doubt easiest 5 star rating ive ever given film exceeds expectations every possible level even second watch popular highest rated film letterboxd good reason appeals cinephile crowd filled allegory metaphor exploring questioning underlining fundamentals systems always place also appeals general audiences one wildly entertaining movies ever excellent usage editing original premise fascinating enough keep interest entire film find juxtaposition opposite social classes pretty spot times effective nonetheless say one negative thing film would bong portrays lower class kim family people capable getting living con life also dont fully disagree portrayal way lower class powerless hierarchies capitalist society really bong portrays family lazy anything unmotivated even complete simple task folding pizza boxes misportrayal entire social class quickly lost insanity turn film takes second half,without doubt easiest 5 star rating ive ever given film exceeds expectation every possible level even second watch popular highest rated film letterboxd good reason appeal cinephile crowd filled allegory metaphor exploring questioning underlining fundamental system always place also appeal general audience one wildly entertaining movie ever excellent usage editing original premise fascinating enough keep interest entire film find juxtaposition opposite social class pretty spot time effective nonetheless say one negative thing film would bong portrays lower class kim family people capable getting living con life also dont fully disagree portrayal way lower class powerless hierarchy capitalist society really bong portrays family lazy anything unmotivated even complete simple task folding pizza box misportrayal entire social class quickly lost insanity turn film take second half,positive

It occurred to me how unfair this was, to view the same work of art in a different light simply because it received recognition that elevated it even higher than simply a work acclaimed critically and the first picture out of Korea to ever receive a nomination from the Academy, which is remarkable if you consider their rich history of cinema. I couldn't help but think of the box office success Parasite has received, specifically since Oscar night, with so many people seeking it out knowing that it had just swept the major categories of Original Screenplay, Director and Picture. Such lofty expectations created by the award season narrative, to sit in a theater not just expecting good nor great but the best. The good news is, if there is a film out there to rise to such expectations for an audience, a film that truly has something for everyone as it pleases both on a surface level and also with so much to say regarding income inequality and class warfare, Bong Joon-Ho's Parasite is that picture.

Parasite does this really well by making us laugh and feel suspense, while also showing how tough life can be for the working class in South Korea. The way the story is told, how it's directed, the speed of the movie, and how it looks on screen all come together perfectly. Every scene makes you feel something deep. The movie's message is important, especially now when the rich can escape problems by going to private islands, while the poor are losing their homes and jobs. Parasite proved that even movies with small budgets can win big awards and make people from all over the world appreciate non-English movies, once they get used to reading subtitles.

I think I went through every emotion that is possible whilst in the process of viewing this film. It starts off as a comedy then goes to drama, horror (I was scared), domestic thriller then just like a regular thriller then a heartwrenching, tear-bringing cathartic display of empowerment and importance of family! 'Parasite' seriously packs a punch. I think everything that has needed to be said about it has been said. The cast is perfect (and snubbed might I add) and the story is so twisty turny that on a second watch I probably couldn't tell you what happens next.

Parasite, despite being a microcosmic study of the dangers of class inequality on a broad societal level, shocked me by managing to work equally well as both an allegory and as an engaging thriller! Bong Joon Ho's efforts are genuinely masterful here on every level, as he playfully sets up the puzzle pieces in the first act, before the narrative shifts in a way that was at both wildly unpredictable and completely necessary. This shift arrives just as the film threatened to stagnate within the bounds of it's initial premise, and instead managed to build upon itself in a manner that managed to be equal parts gripping and insightful. The result leaned into the mix of overt social commentary and dark comedy that I've come to love from him, the insanely tight script managing to find an emotional hook for everything that occurs in spite of the fact that every element manages to serve a dual role in the overarching metaphor (and oftentimes, has a literal or thematic double within the bounds of the narrative as well). The look and feel that he creates for this film does a lot of work in reinforcing the narrative: the graceful and purposeful camerawork, in combination with the richly detailed production design are vital in reinforcing both the pathos and logos of a story whose tightrope walk could have so easily fallen into disaster.",im craziest stories predominantly predicated metaphors allegory search relating deeper meaning almost always tends come expense narrative coherence emotional depth leaving audience little gain work beyond direct ideological intentions creator parasite despite microcosmic study dangers class inequality broad societal level shocked managing work equally well allegory engaging thriller bong joon hos efforts genuinely masterful every level playfully sets puzzle pieces first act narrative shifts way wildly unpredictable completely necessary shift arrives film threatened stagnate within bounds initial premise instead managed build upon manner managed equal parts gripping insightful result leaned mix overt social commentary dark comedy ive come love insanely tight script managing find emotional hook everything occurs spite fact every element manages serve dual role overarching metaphor oftentimes literal thematic double within bounds narrative well look feel creates film lot work reinforcing narrative graceful purposeful camerawork combination richly detailed production design vital reinforcing pathos logos story whose tightrope walk could easily fallen disaster,im craziest story predominantly predicated metaphor allegory search relating deeper meaning almost always tends come expense narrative coherence emotional depth leaving audience little gain work beyond direct ideological intention creator parasite despite microcosmic study danger class inequality broad societal level shocked managing work equally well allegory engaging thriller bong joon ho effort genuinely masterful every level playfully set puzzle piece first act narrative shift way wildly unpredictable completely necessary shift arrives film threatened stagnate within bound initial premise instead managed build upon manner managed equal part gripping insightful result leaned mix overt social commentary dark comedy ive come love insanely tight script managing find emotional hook everything occurs spite fact every element manages serve dual role overarching metaphor oftentimes literal thematic double within bound narrative well look feel creates film lot work reinforcing narrative graceful purposeful camerawork combination richly detailed production design vital reinforcing pathos logo story whose tightrope walk could easily fallen disaster,positive

And while Parasite might not be the best movie I‚Äôve seen all year, there‚Äôs still a lot to enjoy here. The entire cast is fantastic, from Choi Woo-shik as Ki-taek's son, Kim Ki-woo to Cho Yeo-jeong, as Dong-ik's wife, Choi Yeon-gyo. It‚Äôs certainly a visual feast for the eyes, as cinematographer Hong Kyung-pyon, collaborates with screenwriters Joon-ho and Han Jin-won to provide lots of social commentary throughout. However, most of it is subtle and will probably take you more than one viewing to understand it. I will say that one message I kind of understood, was that ‚ÄúParasites‚Äù can come from anywhere, and that we are all trying to get ahead, regardless of our social status. There‚Äôs probably a lot that I didn‚Äôt quite understand, so I am interested to revisit and dissect it. Jeong Jae-il delivers a haunting score, that will terrify you, especially in the 2nd half of the film. Unfortunately, I felt the pacing drag on a bit, during that time and the plot conveniences were ABUNDANT. I know the Park family is supposed to be naive, but there‚Äôs no way any one can be that dumbfounded. The twist ‚Äúincident‚Äù was very realistic though, and the movie also has some decent humor, too.

Both take a turn away from the excesses in those films, and in an unshowy way help ground the film in a way that I wouldn't have expected. What's maintained from SNOWPIERCER and OKJA is the social critique, which reaches, somehow, new levels of scathingness, without ever overpowering the actual story of the film.

1051,"Bong Joon-ho's Parasite is absolutely, almost immeasurably incredible. The most spectacular quality about it is it's ability to completely defy any Western ideals of genre, opting to forge its own identity with fury and marvelous execution. In some respects it's a razor-sharp comedy that laughs in the face of imposter syndrome, and on the other hand it's this beautiful image of a family fighting tooth and nail to make the best life for one another. Parasite taps into what I believe is a universal ideal; that of making something of yourself in life, in order to repay what your family has given you.

It‚Äôs a nonstop thrill ride, there‚Äôs no denying that, and the thesis behind the film also appears to be overly palatable and generally agreeable, even towards western audiences, who it feels like are the demographic Bong made this for. A social message regarding class consciousness which is made in order to be palatable, and not to provide a nuanced take on the issue, comes with its own slew of inherent drawbacks however. The shallowness of this allegory can be seen right from the beginning, with the working class Kim family literally depicted in a basement, seemingly lost in the forgotten depths of society‚Äôs dirtiest corner, while the bourgeois Parks are written with the worst, shallowest, stereotypes of ignorant rich people you will ever see. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with this i suppose, as Bong is accomplishing what he set out to, but there is just no nuance to these portrayals whatsoever thematically. Despite the film‚Äôs misguided attempts at achieving class consciousness, i still can‚Äôt find myself disliking this movie because it is simply too effective from a non-thematic sense.

Pretty soon it's evident that the capitalist system itself is parasitic making everyone caught up in it parasites feeding off of anyone they can in a big rat race.

There's warmth in there like a family saga that has you rooting for them to pull this caper off. But that's not entirely what this is about. Through scheming and deceit they make it into this beautiful mansion where things start spiraling out of control as the picture veers from insanely sharp humor to escalating levels of violence and then even a killer slasher film vibe as a symbol of pent up resentment over the blatant injustice of it all.

That's not to undermine what Parasite does on it's own merit, it's just, I don't feel like I'm actually seeing anything new, conceptually (and so recently for that matter). On the surface level, it's certainly intriguing and enjoyable, but even then, I feel like it doesn't go as far as the story needed it to. The ""twist"" is definitely surprising, but then, it just kind of sits there. It ends up being more a comedy of manners, or even, a farce, when it could have been something more horrifying/crazy, which would've been far more effective allegorically. Also (I'm trying to get all the comparisons/negatives out of the way, because there are praises I want to bestow), this seems like it doesn't want to indict anyone in the problems with capitalism, whereas, Burning wants to indict everyone; that subtle difference I think is crucial in effectiveness (everyone‚Äôs a victim vs. everyone is culpable).

1490,"Bong Joon-ho's Korean dark comedy is fiendishly funny right from the outset, starting out with a poor family managing to con their way into the lives of a wealthy family and their home, setting the stage for a pin-sharp satire of class and privilege; while much of it is directly pointed at the massive inequality and social divides in Korean society, those ideas are so universal that they translate very well. The direction is intelligent and intricately precise, especially the way it moves around the home that makes up the majority of the running time and how the characters sneak through it, and carefully balancing an evolving tone with characters who are selfish and opportunistic, even if they are rich enough to be outwardly 'nice'. If it was simply an amusing-but-sinister farce, this would still be one of my favourite films of this year, but the way the story progresses adds a whole other dimension to the premise, becoming something altogether unexpected. That is what gives the movie a real punch to it that is very much in keeping Joon-ho's previous work like The Host, especially in a show-stopping conclusion that simply left me stunned. Parasite is a movie that is best to go into knowing as little about it as possible and just become completely immersed in an entertaining and daring piece of work.

It was a mostly self-deprecating hunch, not voiced with a trace of condescension against uninformed foreigners, but genuine concern that he might have aimed for too narrow of a target audience. To an extent I get his reservations, which clearly turned out to be unfounded when the jury declared his project the unanimously selected winner of the Palme D‚ÄôOr. On a surface level, everyone can figure out that he is drawing a satirical parable of the stark class disparities in his home country of South Korea, where thousands of college graduates would apparently jump at the chance to be a full-time chauffeur for a business tycoon. While educated and wealthy tech executives can afford to reside in fancy homes designed by celebrated architects, entire families are cramped into moldy, insect-ridden basement rooms without power, let alone WiFi.

Parasite starts uncomfortably funny, morphs into skin-crawling terror, then settles on gut-wrenching emotional turmoil. It had me utterly hooked and consistently surprised. It's been a while since I've seen a film that creates such a tangible physical environment. Most of the story unfolds in an obscenely expensive and beautifully designed house. It is so beautifully tied into the action. Joon-ho and crew always make sure we know exactly where we are. It is also a powerful reflection of the film's themes, especially in harsh comparison to the semi-basement dwelling we open with. The players that move within the house are all brilliant. Song Kang-ho's small moments are as impressive as his violent turns. Cho Yeo-jeong is wonderfully tense, and Lee Sun-kyun is quietly despicable. Park So-dam is the highlight with her raucous, manipulative, drunken performance. I hope to see her in more things. Like Snowpiercer and Memories of Murder, Parasite left me buzzing and pleasantly shell-shocked.

The Korean trickster god is above all known for his uncategorisable movie melees which tumble bloodily down the genre stairs hitting every step - comedy, horror, drama, social commentary, slasher, creature feature, murder mystery, manifesto for vegetarianism - on the way. But while Parasite certainly cycles through more than half the list, the vicious and sob more despairing than we've ever had from him before. Bong is back and on brilliant form, but he is unmistakably, roaringly furious, and it registers because the target is so deserving and enormous, so 2019: Parasite is a tick fat with the bitter blood of class range. It doesn't start that way. With typical feint-and-parry dexterity, the film begins as a so-close-its- almost-self-conscious Korean reworking of the last year's Palme d' Or winner Shoplifters.

1643,"Compare the living room windows of the Kim and Park families. Parasite's opening shot begins with the former - a vantage point that is below street level, permeable to all of the filth, clatter, and hardship of the slums. Moments into the film, Kang-ho Song's Ki-taek Kim encourages leaving the windows open so that pesticide can seep into the apartment and exterminate an infestation of stink bugs for free (or the low cost of the family's discomfort). Though the Park family's window is more readily transparent - a floor to ceiling glass exterior - it looks out upon a barrier to the rest of Korean society; hedges taller than the residents wall off the outside world, sealing off the family's lavish mansion. Dong-ik Park repeatedly warns Ki-taek not to ""cross the line"" referring to the candor of their conversation, but Joon-ho Bong suggests that line is a lot more metaphorical (""It's so metaphorical!""). In the world of Parasite (and, considering Burning deals with similar issues, contemporary Korean society, in general) the layers - or lines - stratifying the classes are akin to hermetic seals. The wealthy treat the poor like a disease, anxious that if their staff are not vetted correctly the ""wrong"" people could get in.

Bong Joon-ho is a genius when it comes to directing and it‚Äôs very well acted to, but I think what really had me interested was the story involving the differences in class and also the mounding tension that was building throughout. This is obviously a film that you have to give your undivided attention to due to the fact that it‚Äôs in Korean, which is the aspect of it that I was the most worried about going into it. But I did not find it difficult at all to stay focused because this film is so engaging and I loved it till the last second. The climax is fantastic and the way that they built up to it was perfect. One thing I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about during the whole film is how much I liked the name of the film.

1947,"A poor family, the Kims, con their way into becoming the servants of a rich family, the Parks. But their easy life gets complicated when their deception is threatened with exposure. Bong Joon Ho‚Äôs masterpiece is as impeccably designed and structured as the Park‚Äôs dream home. Much like his previous works, Bong Joon Ho provides commentary on the current state of affairs at the time. His views on social and class divide have been a constant source of storytelling and motivation for his characters. Parasite is no different, the divide between the Kim family and the Parks is evident, as the Kim family slowly infect and infiltrate their more affluent hosts. Bong Joon Ho handles the tonal shifts with great skill although not subtle, the tonal shifts feel very natural as events seem to spiral out of control. Parasite begins as easily some of the most comedic work of his career as the Kim family hustle and con their way through existence as the narrative progresses as we stumble through a chain of events that can simply be described as opening Pandora‚Äôs box as it takes a dark and tragic turn. Meanwhile this is all held together with Bong Joon Ho‚Äôs masterful direction and his very charming and adaptable cast who are all on exquisite form. The very fact that there are no clear heroes nor villains is another master stoke as this is up to the viewer and their own ethics. It feels very much that all his earlier work has been building towards crafting this masterpiece, from his use of powerful imagery to creating very real and relatable characters. By navigating the labyrinth we are delving more into the mind of how Bong Joon Ho operates, by letting the story unfold we led to believe that Joon Ho is very clear on his stance about today‚Äôs society. Even though there is this huge class divide there are still human beings on each side and this is what he taps into; the humanity. Overall, Parasite deserves every award it has won and then some as this can simply be described as a masterpiece and a very high bar set for all filmmaking for the coming decade.",poor family kims con way becoming servants rich family parks easy life gets complicated deception threatened exposure bong joon hos masterpiece impeccably designed structured parks dream home much like previous works bong joon ho provides commentary current state affairs time views social class divide constant source storytelling motivation characters parasite different divide kim family parks evident kim family slowly infect infiltrate affluent hosts bong joon ho handles tonal shifts great skill although subtle tonal shifts feel natural events seem spiral control parasite begins easily comedic work career kim family hustle con way existence narrative progresses stumble chain events simply described opening pandoras box takes dark tragic turn meanwhile held together bong joon hos masterful direction charming adaptable cast exquisite form fact clear heroes villains another master stoke viewer ethics feels much earlier work building towards crafting masterpiece use powerful imagery creating real relatable characters navigating labyrinth delving mind bong joon ho operates letting story unfold led believe joon ho clear stance todays society even though huge class divide still human beings side taps humanity overall parasite deserves every award simply described masterpiece high bar set filmmaking coming decade,poor family kims con way becoming servant rich family park easy life get complicated deception threatened exposure bong joon ho masterpiece impeccably designed structured park dream home much like previous work bong joon ho provides commentary current state affair time view social class divide constant source storytelling motivation character parasite different divide kim family park evident kim family slowly infect infiltrate affluent host bong joon ho handle tonal shift great skill although subtle tonal shift feel natural event seem spiral control parasite begin easily comedic work career kim family hustle con way existence narrative progress stumble chain event simply described opening pandora box take dark tragic turn meanwhile held together bong joon ho masterful direction charming adaptable cast exquisite form fact clear hero villain another master stoke viewer ethic feel much earlier work building towards crafting masterpiece use powerful imagery creating real relatable character navigating labyrinth delving mind bong joon ho operates letting story unfold led believe joon ho clear stance today society even though huge class divide still human being side tap humanity overall parasite deserves every award simply described masterpiece high bar set filmmaking coming decade,positive

What strikes me about this movie is how these revelations only became exciting to me long after, because the watching of the film itself is a rollicking journey, the best time I‚Äôve had in a cinema in ages. It works as both. A story and tone that keeps surprising. On top of that, a beautiful looking film.

It certainly feels like a culmination of his canon, a mature work from a master who has been building to his magnum opus and finally achieved it. Mixing a comedy of manners with a commentary on class divide, a hauntingly dark, gruesome thriller, and an emotional drama about a poor family simply trying to survive together and achieve some kind of higher position in life, Parasite occupies so many spaces, and yet there isn't a single moment where the tone tilts off-balance.",joel coen said directing comes two words tone management every time finish watching bong joonho film prominent thought mind isnt single director balance tone efficiently parasite least first viewing estimation finest work directors career date certainly feels like culmination canon mature work master building magnum opus finally achieved mixing comedy manners commentary class divide hauntingly dark gruesome thriller emotional drama poor family simply trying survive together achieve kind higher position life parasite occupies many spaces yet isnt single moment tone tilts offbalance,joel coen said directing come two word tone management every time finish watching bong joonho film prominent thought mind isnt single director balance tone efficiently parasite least first viewing estimation finest work director career date certainly feel like culmination canon mature work master building magnum opus finally achieved mixing comedy manner commentary class divide hauntingly dark gruesome thriller emotional drama poor family simply trying survive together achieve kind higher position life parasite occupies many space yet isnt single moment tone tilt offbalance,positive

Despite the ultimate shallowness, there is a ton of merit earned in attention to detail, and how easily specific elements in the movie lend themselves to analysis.

I went to correct her by saying but were not poor.. Then it hit us both, while we not hard on life by any means I wouldn't consider how we live ""rich"" or ""middle Class"" at least not yet... I think that's what Parasite distills so perfectly. The searching for a way out. The creation of a ""plan"" that will save you and put you in a great situation. The truth of the matter unfortunately is. Money, fame, and fortune, have a lot to do with how, when, where, and who you were born to, or the opportunities you land yourself in. Obviously as someone who is definitely a capitalist I don't necessarily agree with every opinion within Parasite, but even a harden money loving man like myself can admit the system of capitalism has its flaws. The income inequality in the united states and around the world only seems to get worse. Not just on a monetary level but on a emotional one as well. Celebs like the Kim and Kanye are worshipped like Gods on the internet, and the culture of ""stuff"" is on the rise. Everyone now seems to have to have the latest shoes, car, rings, whatever it is in order to keep up with everyone else. Parasite exposes system. I could over the acting, cinematography, music, and editing but it's all so perfect. Anything I'd say on the subject would be retreading what hundreds of others have said much better.

Especially on a second viewing - knowing when the twists and shocks were coming, I felt a shade of.... (voice turned to a hushed whisper) *disappointment*? Again, this may well be down to expectations, after feeling first time around that the film had been overpraised, but I did try my best to be objective. The plot ticks along with Swiss-watch regularity, and its absolute steel-constructed solidity is helped by handsome photography, which is enough to make the film look great but didn't particularly impress any images into my mind. Equally, while it is a film of symbols, I felt as many fell flat as landed with significance; with the rather irritating comment ""it's so metaphorical"" ringing in my ears, I don't feel that the film does enough to give the rock or the idea of Native Americans anything approaching feeling at any sub-surface level.

Now we have Parasite that is completely different from his other movies, I‚Äôm not going to say too much about this movie since it is sort of hard to talk about without spoiling. So I‚Äôm just going to go over the basics, the performances by everyone Involved is really well done especially the main leads. They give incredibly realistic performances that later on do become pretty intense and thrilling, the writing is absolutly well done and definitely one of the biggest highlights of the movie. Everything about it was really believable and once again led to some fantastic scenes! The cinematography is absolutely incredible, it‚Äôs beautifully shot and adds a lot of detail in the setting. Speaking of which I absolutely love the setting, I thought it was so well done and actually really clever the setting compliments the story quite a bit which in the long run makes it all worth it! But what I think this movie masters in is how quickly it gets the viewer‚Äôs attention...from the first couple scenes you are already invested and keep wondering what‚Äôs going to happen next! That‚Äôs something a lot of movies as of late have done a very poor job at, so it was very refreshing to see a movie actually do that! The characters were all really done and well written, they felt very realistic and well felt like actual people. It also has this blend of comedy, drama thriller aspect which it definitely masters really well!

There is no morally good, upstanding family here. Nor is there a totally malicious one.

2215,"A brilliant construction of obvious metaphors that conceal/reveal intractable horrors while slick staging and deft maneuvering among protagonists, genres and tones gradually bring the cruel inflexibility of class into unsettling, sharp focus. As such, a culmination of Bong's work since Memories of Murder, which refracted actual unsolved crimes through a prism of genre, its destabilizing bouts of surrealism and comedy evocative of the shifting ground beneath detectives and locals struggling to make sense of random, recurring savagery. What I wrote in my lboxd blurb of MoM, of Bong wisely underplaying his big honking visual metaphors, gets its fullest expression here. For all the thrilling execution of his second act, the sequence following the Kims back to their home in the pouring rain is the true masterstroke - a series of wide shots of them descending flooding streets and staircases, the polluted water already far ahead of them, backing up the drains and devastating their neighborhood, culminating in an overhead shot of an anonymous family drifting down the street clinging to a table like a life raft. (I was reminded of Tsai Ming-liang's Stray Dogs, a much more formally rigorous film about a family struggling to survive poverty in the crawlspaces of a metropolis.) With much of the film bifurcated between two living spaces, choosing this moment to trace the path from one down to the other serves as a widening of scope that situates the relatively small scale of Bong's drama within the larger urban landscape of Seoul (and in the shot of the displaced people packed into the temporary shelter of the gym, a reminder that the Kims are but one family among many in desperate circumstances) and his nimble narrative and formal manipulations within a rigid socioeconomic and geographic structure that engenders the rage and hopelessness that leads Parasite to its queasily lingering finale.",brilliant construction obvious metaphors concealreveal intractable horrors slick staging deft maneuvering among protagonists genres tones gradually bring cruel inflexibility class unsettling sharp focus culmination bongs work since memories murder refracted actual unsolved crimes prism genre destabilizing bouts surrealism comedy evocative shifting ground beneath detectives locals struggling make sense random recurring savagery wrote lboxd blurb mom bong wisely underplaying big honking visual metaphors gets fullest expression thrilling execution second act sequence following kims back home pouring rain true masterstroke series wide shots descending flooding streets staircases polluted water already far ahead backing drains devastating neighborhood culminating overhead shot anonymous family drifting street clinging table like life raft reminded tsai mingliangs stray dogs much formally rigorous film family struggling survive poverty crawlspaces metropolis much film bifurcated two living spaces choosing moment trace path one serves widening scope situates relatively small scale bongs drama within larger urban landscape seoul shot displaced people packed temporary shelter gym reminder kims one family among many desperate circumstances nimble narrative formal manipulations within rigid socioeconomic geographic structure engenders rage hopelessness leads parasite queasily lingering finale,brilliant construction obvious metaphor concealreveal intractable horror slick staging deft maneuvering among protagonist genre tone gradually bring cruel inflexibility class unsettling sharp focus culmination bong work since memory murder refracted actual unsolved crime prism genre destabilizing bout surrealism comedy evocative shifting ground beneath detective local struggling make sense random recurring savagery wrote lboxd blurb mom bong wisely underplaying big honking visual metaphor get fullest expression thrilling execution second act sequence following kims back home pouring rain true masterstroke series wide shot descending flooding street staircase polluted water already far ahead backing drain devastating neighborhood culminating overhead shot anonymous family drifting street clinging table like life raft reminded tsai mingliangs stray dog much formally rigorous film family struggling survive poverty crawlspace metropolis much film bifurcated two living space choosing moment trace path one serf widening scope situates relatively small scale bong drama within larger urban landscape seoul shot displaced people packed temporary shelter gym reminder kims one family among many desperate circumstance nimble narrative formal manipulation within rigid socioeconomic geographic structure engenders rage hopelessness lead parasite queasily lingering finale,negative

2315,"It only took months and months, but I finally saw Parasite, the movie that everyone has been talking about -- and now I see why it has started so many conversations, garnered numerous accolades, and ended up on a plethora of Best-of-2019 lists. It is hard to describe to those who have not seen it, and I am glad that people have kept the twists secretive. The less you know about it, the better. Boon Joon-Ho, who directed the fascinating dystopian English-language film Snowpiercer, has crafted a film about two vastly different Korean families whose lives collide in unexpected ways. Parasite is, at times, hilarious without being too silly, thrilling without being unbelievable, and heartbreaking without being corny. Writer-director Ho has called it a ""tragicomedy,"" which seems about right; what starts as a satire about a lower class unemployed Korean family infiltrating an upper class family turns into something else entirely, and that's what make the film so engaging and brilliantly inventive. You never know what is going to happen, or when the tone will change drastically within minutes. The entire cast is excellent, with a standout performance by Song Kang-Ho as the well-meaning, caring father of the lower class family. Even when it veers away from the satirical to a more serious tone, Parasite never loses its focus on the enormous gaps in lifestyles and personalities of those in the lower and upper classes - no matter where you live.",took months months finally saw parasite movie everyone talking see started many conversations garnered numerous accolades ended plethora bestof2019 lists hard describe seen glad people kept twists secretive less know better boon joonho directed fascinating dystopian englishlanguage film snowpiercer crafted film two vastly different korean families whose lives collide unexpected ways parasite times hilarious without silly thrilling without unbelievable heartbreaking without corny writerdirector ho called tragicomedy seems right starts satire lower class unemployed korean family infiltrating upper class family turns something else entirely thats make film engaging brilliantly inventive never know going happen tone change drastically within minutes entire cast excellent standout performance song kangho wellmeaning caring father lower class family even veers away satirical serious tone parasite never loses focus enormous gaps lifestyles personalities lower upper classes matter live,took month month finally saw parasite movie everyone talking see started many conversation garnered numerous accolade ended plethora bestof2019 list hard describe seen glad people kept twist secretive less know better boon joonho directed fascinating dystopian englishlanguage film snowpiercer crafted film two vastly different korean family whose life collide unexpected way parasite time hilarious without silly thrilling without unbelievable heartbreaking without corny writerdirector ho called tragicomedy seems right start satire lower class unemployed korean family infiltrating upper class family turn something else entirely thats make film engaging brilliantly inventive never know going happen tone change drastically within minute entire cast excellent standout performance song kangho wellmeaning caring father lower class family even veers away satirical serious tone parasite never loses focus enormous gap lifestyle personality lower upper class matter live,positive

Peele is more interested in his characters, they are more vivid ‚Äì he never leaves a character, it's one of the reasons that Us often feels inflated.

2383,"2019 movie viewings, #117. I know it sounds a bit racist at first to say that no one does horror quite like the South Koreans; but I mean that less as a statement about South Koreans themselves and more a cultural reflection of the current state of the South Korean film industry, which for some reason has embraced the idea of horror as a harbinger of social change way more than most other nations' film industries (especially the US, which despite its recent run of indie hits is still mostly defined by the franchise-friendly '80s paradigm of ""Holy Fuck, It's Gonna Kill Us All!""). Bong Joon Ho is a great example of what I'm talking about, a director who has always inserted at least a dollop of political commentary into his genre flicks, most recently in his otherwise cartoonish ""the rich fight the poor in a luxury supertrain"" actioner Snowpiercer. But in his newest, the universally praised Parasite (which last week officially became the highest rated film in the history of Letterboxd), Bong both ups the ante of his political activism, and dials down his message into a subtle and complex milieu that defies easy explanation, easily the main reason that this film seems to be resonating with such a larger part of the general population than psychological horror movies usually do.",2019 movie viewings 117 know sounds bit racist first say one horror quite like south koreans mean less statement south koreans cultural reflection current state south korean film industry reason embraced idea horror harbinger social change way nations film industries especially us despite recent run indie hits still mostly defined franchisefriendly 80s paradigm holy fuck gon na kill us bong joon ho great example im talking director always inserted least dollop political commentary genre flicks recently otherwise cartoonish rich fight poor luxury supertrain actioner snowpiercer newest universally praised parasite last week officially became highest rated film history letterboxd bong ups ante political activism dials message subtle complex milieu defies easy explanation easily main reason film seems resonating larger part general population psychological horror movies usually,2019 movie viewing 117 know sound bit racist first say one horror quite like south korean mean less statement south korean cultural reflection current state south korean film industry reason embraced idea horror harbinger social change way nation film industry especially u despite recent run indie hit still mostly defined franchisefriendly 80 paradigm holy fuck gon na kill u bong joon ho great example im talking director always inserted least dollop political commentary genre flick recently otherwise cartoonish rich fight poor luxury supertrain actioner snowpiercer newest universally praised parasite last week officially became highest rated film history letterboxd bong ups ante political activism dial message subtle complex milieu defies easy explanation easily main reason film seems resonating larger part general population psychological horror movie usually,positive

2522,"Arriving on a wave of hype since its Palme d‚ÄôOr win in May, Bong Joon-ho‚Äôs Parasite is every bit as mesmerizing as the buzz surrounding it suggests. With a razor-sharp script and excellent contributions from all players involved on both sides of the camera, it sunk its hooks into me within the opening minutes and never let go. Bong aims for many thematic and aesthetic targets over the course of the film, and he hits virtually every one with stunning precision. As a satire on social climbing and the aloofness of the upper class, it‚Äôs dead-on and has parallels to the American Dream that American viewers are unlikely to miss; as a dark comedy, it‚Äôs often laugh-aloud hilarious in its audacity; as a thriller, it has brilliantly-executed moments of tension and surprises that genuinely caught me off-guard; and as a drama about family dynamics, it has tender moments that stand out all the more because of how they‚Äôre juxtaposed with so much cynicism elsewhere in the film. Handling so many different tones is an immensely difficult balancing act, yet Bong handles all of it so skillfully that he makes it feel effortless. Though I often had the sense that something horrible was just seconds away from happening, the film plays its twists and turns close to the vest and I found myself surprised and startled by numerous developments. The acting is superb across the board, particularly from Song Kang-ho as the deceptive family‚Äôs patriarch and Cho Yeo-jeong as the na√Øve mother of the wealthy family. Song is convincing as an embattled opportunist who seems like he‚Äôs just one push away from cracking, and Cho‚Äôs obliviousness to the Kim family‚Äôs grifting and the ways in which her privilege have sealed her off from the real world often make for effective humor. Taken as a whole, Parasite covers so much ground and leaves viewers with so much to unpack that it‚Äôs tough not to get swept up in it as it runs and continue to ponder its messages and implications after it ends. It‚Äôs an experience unlike any other I‚Äôve had at a movie this year.",arriving wave hype since palme dor win may bong joonhos parasite every bit mesmerizing buzz surrounding suggests razorsharp script excellent contributions players involved sides camera sunk hooks within opening minutes never let go bong aims many thematic aesthetic targets course film hits virtually every one stunning precision satire social climbing aloofness upper class deadon parallels american dream american viewers unlikely miss dark comedy often laughaloud hilarious audacity thriller brilliantlyexecuted moments tension surprises genuinely caught offguard drama family dynamics tender moments stand theyre juxtaposed much cynicism elsewhere film handling many different tones immensely difficult balancing act yet bong handles skillfully makes feel effortless though often sense something horrible seconds away happening film plays twists turns close vest found surprised startled numerous developments acting superb across board particularly song kangho deceptive familys patriarch cho yeojeong na√Øve mother wealthy family song convincing embattled opportunist seems like hes one push away cracking chos obliviousness kim familys grifting ways privilege sealed real world often make effective humor taken whole parasite covers much ground leaves viewers much unpack tough get swept runs continue ponder messages implications ends experience unlike ive movie year,arriving wave hype since palme dor win may bong joonhos parasite every bit mesmerizing buzz surrounding suggests razorsharp script excellent contribution player involved side camera sunk hook within opening minute never let go bong aim many thematic aesthetic target course film hit virtually every one stunning precision satire social climbing aloofness upper class deadon parallel american dream american viewer unlikely miss dark comedy often laughaloud hilarious audacity thriller brilliantlyexecuted moment tension surprise genuinely caught offguard drama family dynamic tender moment stand theyre juxtaposed much cynicism elsewhere film handling many different tone immensely difficult balancing act yet bong handle skillfully make feel effortless though often sense something horrible second away happening film play twist turn close vest found surprised startled numerous development acting superb across board particularly song kangho deceptive family patriarch cho yeojeong na√Øve mother wealthy family song convincing embattled opportunist seems like he one push away cracking chos obliviousness kim family grifting way privilege sealed real world often make effective humor taken whole parasite cover much ground leaf viewer much unpack tough get swept run continue ponder message implication end experience unlike ive movie year,positive

2524,"Can you forgive the last twenty percent of a film that absolutely kills it for the first eighty percent? That's the question that ‚ÄúParasite‚Äù poses after starting out as a con caper before turning miraculously into a class warfare horror-thriller. All along the way, there's a palpable electricity in the air, a stirring sense of inventiveness at work. The tension is turned up so high and the conflict at the heart of the movie is so novel that it's almost enough to see the setup without the payoff.

2531,"I applaud Bong for his work here, which is certainly best picture-worthy. Once again, he practises his favourite exercise of juggling multiple genres and it comes to fruition moderately well. You'd as well give him his own genre, as by now defining his body of work generally amounts to ""crime-drama thriller with a hint of dark comedy and possibly action - sci-fi too if the film's in English"". His return to his home country is a prolific one, with what might be the effort with the most control over its tonal shifts and genre parameters. Fundamentally, it's a well-made crowdpleaser that impresses on its clever deviations from most mainstream cinema and thrill-value. Act 2's twist is one of the better ones in recent memory and is the moment the film transitions into darker territory. If I must nitpick, the morse code nonsense is tough to swallow and the third act completely falls apart/goes all over the place. Still, I was entertained, and that's better than what 90% of new releases accomplish.",applaud bong work certainly best pictureworthy practises favourite exercise juggling multiple genres comes fruition moderately well youd well give genre defining body work generally amounts crimedrama thriller hint dark comedy possibly action scifi films english return home country prolific one might effort control tonal shifts genre parameters fundamentally wellmade crowdpleaser impresses clever deviations mainstream cinema thrillvalue act 2s twist one better ones recent memory moment film transitions darker territory must nitpick morse code nonsense tough swallow third act completely falls apartgoes place still entertained thats better 90 new releases accomplish,applaud bong work certainly best pictureworthy practises favourite exercise juggling multiple genre come fruition moderately well youd well give genre defining body work generally amount crimedrama thriller hint dark comedy possibly action scifi film english return home country prolific one might effort control tonal shift genre parameter fundamentally wellmade crowdpleaser impress clever deviation mainstream cinema thrillvalue act 2 twist one better one recent memory moment film transition darker territory must nitpick morse code nonsense tough swallow third act completely fall apartgoes place still entertained thats better 90 new release accomplish,positive
